# Field Observations

## Session 1 — Manual Raking & Collection
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Conditions:** Early fall season, lawn area

### Observations

**1. Acorn Embedment**
- Acorns on the lawn for several weeks work down into the turf and are significantly harder to dislodge
- Fresh-fallen acorns are much easier to collect
- Implication: frequent collection (weekly during fall) is more effective than infrequent deep cleaning
- Design decision: target fresh-fallen acorns — do not over-engineer for deeply embedded case

**2. Debris — Twigs and Leaves**
- Significant volume of twigs and leaves mixed in with acorns
- Both will interfere with the comb-stripper mechanism (twigs jam, leaves wrap/clog drum)
- **Design decision: accept mixed collection — nuts, twigs and leaves all collected together**
- All material will be mulched in a 1hp Hansa electric mulcher and composted
- No pre-screening, sorting, or debris deflection required
- Manual clog clearing accepted during testing phase
- Twig and branch diameter varies considerably — small twigs to substantial branches
  present on lawn at the same time; clog risk varies accordingly
- Leaves currently low volume but will increase significantly as autumn progresses
- Wet, heavy leaves are harder to collect and damage lawn if left — motivates frequent passes
- **Operational target: daily passes during peak season**
  - Keeps leaf/nut volume manageable per run
  - Prevents leaves becoming wet and matted
  - Protects lawn from smothering and acorn germination

**3. Terrain — Holes in Lawn**
- Where holes have developed, acorns fall in and are effectively lost
- Confirms drum must have floating/spring-loaded mount to follow terrain
- Accept that hole-trapped acorns are a write-off — do not engineer for this case

**4. Collection Volume**
- Gathered approx 25kg in one session from roughly 1/10th of total drop area
- This is the very start of the fall season (early this year)
- Implies total seasonal load could be very large
- Hopper/bag must handle meaningful volume per run to avoid constant emptying

## Open Questions from Session 1

- [ ] How quickly do acorns embed after falling? (days vs weeks?)
- [ ] What is the total drop area in m²?
- [ ] Target collection frequency during peak fall?
